# ADR-001: Extended NUT Data Mapping

## Status

Accepted (Partially Implemented) — **partially superseded by v1.3.0, see the addendum at the end.**
The body below describes v1.1.0 and is kept as the historical record of that decision; where it and
the addendum disagree, the addendum is current.

## Context

The `fake_battery_nut` kernel module exposes NUT UPS data through the Linux power_supply subsystem. Initially conceived as a way to show UPS stats in btop, we discovered a more significant value proposition:

**NUT claims USB devices exclusively, preventing UPower from seeing UPS hardware natively. This module bridges NUT to UPower, enabling desktop power management integration.**

### Data Flow

                          │
                          ▼
              Desktop Environment (KDE/GNOME)
```

### Why This Matters

Without this bridge:
- NUT works fine for monitoring and scripted shutdown
- UPower cannot see the UPS (`ups_hiddev*` doesn't exist)
- Desktop environments have no idea a UPS exists
- No battery icon, no low-power warnings, no auto-hibernate

With this bridge:
- Desktop sees UPS as a battery via `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0`
- KDE/GNOME show battery status, respond to power events
- System can auto-hibernate when UPS battery is critical
- btop also works (the original goal)

### Currently Mapped (v1.1.0)

| NUT Field | Control Command | power_supply Property |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| battery.charge | capacity | BAT0/capacity |
| battery.runtime | time | BAT0/time_to_empty_avg |
| battery.voltage | voltage | BAT0/voltage_now |
| ups.status (OL/OB) | status, charging | BAT0/status, AC0/online |
| (settable) | temp | BAT0/temp |

## Decision Drivers

1. **Desktop integration** - UPower/KDE/GNOME can respond to UPS events
2. **power_supply API constraints** - Limited to properties the kernel API supports
3. **Simplicity** - Single battery device, clean UPower integration
4. **The btop irony** - btop only shows `BAT= 100%` anyway

## Problem: BAT1 Pollution (Resolved)

The original design exposed two batteries:
- BAT0: UPS battery charge %
- BAT1: UPS load % (semantically wrong - load isn't a battery)

UPower's `DisplayDevice` averaged both, causing incorrect readings:
- BAT0: 100%, BAT1: 21% → DisplayDevice: ~34% (wrong!)

**Resolution:** Removed BAT1 entirely. Load monitoring available via `upsc` directly.

## Options Considered

### Option A: Minimal Extension ✓ Implemented

Single battery (BAT0) with settable temperature:

| Field | Command | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| capacity | capacity=N | 0-100% |
| runtime | time=N | seconds |
| voltage | voltage=N | microvolts |
| temperature | temp=N | tenths of °C (260 = 26.0°C) |
| status | status=N | 0=discharging, 1=charging, 2=full |
| AC online | charging=N | 0=offline, 1=online |

### Option B: Sysfs Extension (Rejected)

Custom sysfs attributes for all NUT data. Too complex, non-standard attributes may confuse tools.

### Option C: Companion Daemon (Rejected)

JSON/socket daemon for full NUT data. Doesn't help desktop integration - UPower needs power_supply devices.

### Option D: Temperature from hwmon (Deferred)

The daemon could read ambient temperature from system sensors. Currently left as settable placeholder (defaults to 26.0°C). Most consumer UPS units don't report temperature anyway.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clean UPower integration (single battery, accurate %)
- Desktop environments can auto-hibernate on low UPS battery
- Simplified kernel module (removed BAT1 complexity)
- Temperature now displays correctly (was showing 2.6°C, now 26.0°C)

### Negative

- Lost load % monitoring in btop (use `upsc` or other NUT tools)
- Temperature is placeholder unless daemon sets it

### Neutral

- UPower sees device as "battery" not "UPS" (kernel's POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_UPS isn't handled by UPower)

## Implementation Notes

Changes in v1.1.0:
- Removed BAT1 (load meter) - fixes UPower DisplayDevice pollution
- Simplified control interface (removed numbered suffixes: `capacity0` → `capacity`)
- Fixed temperature unit bug (26 → 260 tenths of °C)
- Added `temp=N` control command

## The Preserved Irony

We wrote a kernel module because btop doesn't have plugins. btop displays `BAT= 100%`. But accidentally, we built the missing bridge between NUT and desktop power management that nobody else bothered to make.

The walnut-powered PC image remains canonical.

## Addendum (v1.3.0)

The mapping table and the "Consequences" section above are v1.1.0. What changed since:

**There is no placeholder data any more.** Option D described temperature as "left as settable
placeholder (defaults to 26.0 °C)", and the same was true of runtime (3600 s) and voltage (24 V).
Those defaults were invented figures published as though measured — a UPS with no `battery.runtime`
advertised a permanent, unmoving "1 hour remaining". `capacity`, `time`, `voltage` and `temp` now
take a `-1` sentinel meaning "the UPS does not publish this", and the module returns `-ENODATA` for
the matching property so the attribute is simply absent. The daemon emits `temp` from
`battery.temperature`, falling back to `ups.temperature`, and `-1` when neither exists.

**An unknown capacity also reports the battery as not present**, with capacity level `Unknown`.
Measured on 2026-08-03: with `capacity` returning `-ENODATA` and no `CHARGE_*` properties left to
derive from, UPower reports the battery at **0%** — indistinguishable from flat, and enough to trigger
a critical-power action. Reporting it absent keeps `warning-level` at `none`. The device is not
dropped: `line_power_AC0` and the mains signal survive.

**`level=N` was added** as an explicit capacity-level override (0 = derive from capacity, 1..5 =
critical..full), because NUT's `LB` flag — the signal `upsmon` itself shuts down on — previously
reached nothing. The daemon now maps `LB`/`FSD` to `level=1` plus a capacity clamped to
`NUT_LB_CAPACITY` (default 5), since UPower derives its warning level from the percentage when
`UsePercentageForPolicy` is set, so the level alone changes nothing.

**Properties removed.** `CHARGE_NOW`/`CHARGE_FULL`/`CHARGE_FULL_DESIGN` held a percentage while the
class defines them in µAh, which is where the `energy: 0.00276 Wh` reading came from.
`TIME_TO_FULL_NOW` was serving the *discharge* runtime, telling anything reading a charging battery
it would be full in however long it had left.

Option D (temperature from hwmon) remains deferred and is now moot for the placeholder reason given
above: absent a real reading, the module reports nothing rather than 26.0 °C.
